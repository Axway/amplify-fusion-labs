# Invoices APIfication Lab

## Introduction

In these labs, we'll create an integration that will enable us to expose an API for invoices in a database. The integration will also orchestrate and aggregate the invoice data with a currency conversion service to convert the invoice amount to the desired currency as well as calculate a grand total amount of the invoices.

The API we are building is as follows:

`GET /invoices?status=Overdue&currencycode=EUR`

with sample response:

```json
{   
    "success": true,
    "invoices": [
        {
            "invnum": "IN4001",
            "invdate": "2022-11-05",
            "businessname": "ACME Corp",
            "billtoname": "Cesar Bowman",
            "vat": "15%",
            "status": "Overdue",
            "currency": "EUR",
            "totalamt": 462.47
        },
        {
            "invnum": "IN4003",
            "invdate": "2023-01-04",
            "businessname": "Crypto Corp",
            "billtoname": "Jane Doe",
            "vat": "15%",
            "status": "Overdue",
            "currency": "EUR",
            "totalamt": 601.21
        }
    ],
    "currency": "EUR",
    "status": "Overdue",
    "grandTotal": 1063.68
}
```

A demo is shown below:

![demo](images/intro-demo.gif)

The integration is described below:

* Expose a GET API endpoint that retrieves invoices by status and desired currency
* Query a PostgreSql Database
* Loop over the invoices
  * Make a REST API call to a currency conversion service to convert each invoice total amount to a desired currency
  * Total the amounts of each invoice
* Return a payload optimized array of invoices with converted total amount as well as a grand total amount for all invoices

This data flow is illustrated below:

* A Postgres Database for storing our invoice records. In this lab, we have used [**Neon**](https://neon.tech)
* Access to the free [**API Layer Exchange Rates Data API**](https://apilayer.com/marketplace/exchangerates_data-api).
  > Make sure that you subscribe to the API and test the API in Postman so that you are familiar with how to call the API and see its response.

## Lab 1

Let's create the Postgres Database to hold our invoice records.

* Create an account at [**Neon**](https://neon.tech). 
* Create a project and write down the connection details from the psql URL "postgres://_`username`_:_`password`_@_`server`_/_`databaseName`_" for later 
* Select your project and navigate to the SQL Editor tab to run the following 3 database requests: 
  * Create an invoice table:

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE Invoice (
    created_at      TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at      TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    invid           SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    invnum          VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    invdate         DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE,
    duedate         DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE,
    businessname    VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    businessaddress VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    businessphone   VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    billtoname      VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    billtoaddress   VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    vat             VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    totalamt        MONEY NOT NULL,
    currency        VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    status          VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    notes           VARCHAR(100)
  );
  ```

  * Create multiple sample invoices (You can modify the values as you wish)

  ```sql
  INSERT INTO Invoice
    ( invnum,businessName,businessAddress,businessPhone,
      billToName,billToAddress,
      totalAmt,currency,vat,invdate,duedate,status
    )
  VALUES
    ( 'IN4001','ACME Corp','3734 Jacobs Street,Pittsburgh, PA, 15201 , USA','412-297-3188',
      'Cesar Bowman','3734 Jacobs Street,Pittsburgh, PA, 15201 , USA',
      500.00,'USD','15%',(select current_date - 90),(select current_date - 60),'Overdue'
    ),
    ( 'IN4002','Hillside Inc','144 Main St,NY, NY, 10021 , USA','212-444-1122',
      'John Smith','144 Main St,NY, BY, 10021 , USA',
      700.00,'USD','15%',(select current_date - 30),(select current_date - 1),'Paid'
    ),
    ( 'IN4003','Crypto Corp','19 Summer Ave,Miami, FL, 88088 , USA','212-444-1122',
      'Jane Doe','19 Summer Ave,Miami, FL, 88088 , USA',
      650.00,'USD','15%',(select current_date - 30),(select current_date -1),'Overdue'
    ),
    ( 'IN4004','Jamee Corp','111 French St,New Orelans, LA, 79890 , USA','212-444-1122',
      'John Smith','144 Main St,NY, BY, 10021 , USA',
      900.00,'USD','15%',(select current_date - 1),(select current_date + 30),'Sent'
    );
  ```

  * Check that invoices are available in the database :

  ```sql
  Select * from invoice
  ```

  ![sql editor](images/lab1-sql-editor.png)

Now the database is ready.

## Lab 2

In this lab, we'll create our integration and define the REST API endpoint using an HTTP/S Server Component and associated connection and then we'll query our database for invoices with a particular status.

* Create a new integration (e.g. GetInvoicesByStatus)
* Click on the Event button and add an HTTP/S Server component and choose GET method
  * We'll need an HTTP/S Connection so click on Add next to Connection, provide a connection name and description
  * Select HTTPS for the Protocol and leave Authentication to None for now and click on Update \
  ![HTTPS server connection](images/lab2-https-server-connection.png)
  * Close the connection sub tab and go back to the HTTP/S Server component in the integration, refresh the connection list and select the connection you have just created.
  * Enter `invoices` for the resource path and enter two Query Parameters: `status` and `currencycode` and press Save. The resource path must be unique for your tenant. Since you are most likely working in a shared environment, you may want to prefix the resource path with your initials to make it unique (e.g. lb_invoices) \
  ![HTTPS Server component](images/lab2-https-server-component.png) 
    > Note that we still need to connect the response to the HTTP/S Server component but we'll do that shortly after we've defined the response variable
* Click the plus button to add a Database Select component and expand the bottom panel
  * We need to create a database connection for our Postgres database so click Add next to the Connection picker and give your connection a name and description (e.g. Neon Postgres DB)
    * Select PostgreSQL as Database Type and set the version you used for the database creation (default is 15.x)
    * Update the connection URL with jdbc:postgresql://_`server`_/_`databaseName`_ with `host` and `database name` that you wrote down after database creation (default postgresql port 5432 is not required in the URL)
    * Enter your User Name and Passwordthat you wrote down after database creation
    * click on Update and then on Test \
    ![database connection](images/lab2-database-connection.png)
      > Note that if you get any Connection Timeout errors with the connection then you may want to expand the Advanced section and set `Connection Wait Timeout` to 1000. Don't forget to click update.
    * Close your connection sub tab and return the the Database Select component in your integration
  * Click refresh in the Connections tab and select the database connection you just created
  * We need a plug for selecting invoices by Status so click Add next to the Plug picker and give your plug a name and description (e.g. GetInvoicesByStatus) and click on the Configure button
    * Select the database connector you just created and select `Select` for the Actions and `public` for the schemas
    * Check the box next to your invoice table, and select all the fields
    * Click the Where tab and select `invoice.status` field and the `=` operator and press Generate and click save
    ![database plug configuration](images/lab2-database-plug-configuration.png)
    ![database plug](images/lab2-database-plug_.png)
    * Close the plug sub tab and return to the Database Select component in your integration and click the refresh button in the Plug picker and select the newly created plug
  * Expand `HTTPSServerGetOutput` in the left hand panel to expose the `queryParams->status` and drag a line from status to `GetInvoicesByStatusInput->where->invoice_status` in the ACTION PROPERTIES in the center panel
  * Click the Save button \
  ![database component](images/lab2-database-component_.png)
* We are going to declare a response variables that we'll use in the integration. This is the response returned to the client.
  * Right click on any variable in the right hand panel and select Extract and paste in the following JSON that describes our desired API response object and click on Copy Node button
    ```json
    {
        "grandTotal": 1049.51,
        "status": "Overdue",
        "currency": "EUR",
        "success": true,
        "invoices": [
            {
                "currency": "EUR",
                "totalamt": 456.31,
                "invnum": "IN4001",
                "invdate": "2023-01-12",
                "businessname": "ACME Corp",
                "billtoname": "Cesar Bowman",
                "vat": "15%"
            },
            {
                "currency": "EUR",
                "totalamt": 593.17,
                "invnum": "IN4003",
                "invdate": "2023-03-13",
                "businessname": "Crypto Corp",
                "billtoname": "Jane Doe",
                "vat": "15%"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```
  ![extract json](images/lab2-extract-json.png)
  * Right click again and select Paste and name your variable `response`
  ![database component](images/lab2-database-component2.png)

* Now that we've declared our API response variable, let's go back to the HTTP/S Server component and map our response
  * Click on the HTTP/S Server component at the begining of the integration and click on Response \
  ![https server component response](images/lab2-https-server-component-response.png)
  * Click on Map Response and expand the bottom panel
  * Drag a line from the variable `response` in the left panel to the `HttpResponseInput->body` under ACTION PROPERTIES in the center panel and click on Save
  ![https server component response map](images/lab2-https-server-component-response-map_.png)

Your integration should look like this: \
![integration](images/lab2-integration.png)

* Enable your integration and make an API call from your Browser, Postman or curl as follows:

  ```bash
  curl --location --request GET "https://<dataplane-hostname>:9443/invoices?status=Overdue&currencycode=EUR"
  ```

  > The Shared _dataplane hostname_ (in SaaS deployment) in Design mode  is:\
  >  _**tenant-name**-design.prod.integration.**region**.axway.com_\
  >  where _tenant-name_ and _region_ can be found in the current control plane URL that you are using so far.

  > Make sure to update the resource path "/invoices" to match what you defined.

  > The response would be empty for now, so ignore "empty response" error message from your browser or client.

* Find your transaction in the Monitor and click on the Database Select step and expand `GetInvoicesByStatusOutput->resultSet` and see that you are retrieving invoices
![transaction monitoring](images/lab2-transaction-monitoring_.png)

## Lab 3

In this lab, we'll loop over the invoices, parse each one to a JSON object and do a currency conversion on the invoice amount to a desired currency passed into the API call as a query parameter.

* Disable your integration
* Click the plus button and add a For-each component, expand it and click on Config
* Click the down arrow and select the `GetInvoicesByStatusOutput->response->resultSet` array to loop over and click Save
![foreach configuration](images/lab3-foreach-configuration_.png)
* Let's convert the invoice total amount to the desired currency using the APILayer currency conversion API. 
  * Add an HTTP/S Client Get component inside the loop and expand the bottom panel
  * Click Add next to the Connection picker and give your connection a name and description (e.g. Exchange Rates Data API) and do the following:
  * Select HTTPS for the Protocol
  * Select HTTP/2 for the HTTP Version
  * Enter `api.apilayer.com/exchangerates_data` for Url
  * Enter `/symbols` as the Safe Resource Path
  * Add a header named `apikey` and enter your APILayer APIKey
  * Click Update and Test
![https client connection](images/lab3-https-client-connection.png)
* Go back to your HTTP/S Client Get component, click refresh in the Connection picker and select the connection you just created
* In the center panel under ACTION PROPERTIES, expand `HTTPSGetInput` and:
  * Right click on basePath and setValue to `/convert`
  * Right click on `queryParams` and add 3 string variables inside (`amount`, `from` and `to` )  
  * Drag a line from the left hand panel `GetInvoicesByStatusOutput->response->resultSet->invoice_totalamt` to the center panel `HTTPSGetInput->queryParams->amount` to set the amount for the APILayer API
  * Drag a line from the left hand panel `GetInvoicesByStatusOutput->response->resultSet->invoice_currency` to the center panel `HTTPSGetInput->queryParams->from` to set the source currency code for the APILayer API
  * Drag a line from the left hand panel `/HTTPSServerGetOutput->queryParams->currencycode` to the center panel `HTTPSGetInput->queryParams->to` to set the target currency code for the APILayer API
  * Right click on any variable in the right hand panel and select Extract and paste in the following JSON that describes the currency converter API response object and click on Copy Node button

    ```json
    {
        "success": true,
        "query": {
            "from": "USD",
            "to": "EUR",
            "amount": 100
        },
        "info": {
            "timestamp": 1683656343,
            "rate": 0.91192
        },
        "date": "2023-05-09",
        "result": 91.192
    }
    ```

  ![extract json](images/lab4-extract-json.png)
  * Right click again and select Paste and name your variable `currencyConvertResponse`
  * Drag a line from ACTION PROPERTIERS `HTTPSGetOutput->response` to the `currencyConvertResponse` extract variable
  * Press Save
  ![https client component](images/lab3-https-client-component_.png)

* Your integration should look like this:
  ![integration](images/lab3-integration_.png)

* Enable your integration and make an API call from the Browser, Postman or curl as follows:

  ```bash
  curl --location --request GET 'https://<dataplane-hostname>:9443/invoices?status=Overdue&currencycode=EUR'
  ```

* Find your transaction in the Monitor and click on it. You should see the For-each with some number inside indicating the number of invoices
![transaction monitoring](images/lab3-transaction-monitoring.png)
* Click the plus sign next to the For-each and again on one of the iterations
* Click on the HTTP/S Client Get and then expand the HTTPSGetOutput to see the currency conversion API response
![transaction monitoring response details](images/lab3-transaction-monitoring-response-details.png)

## Lab 4

In this lab, we'll map our invoice and currency converted amount to the response invoice array and calculate a grand total.

* Disable your integration to update its design
* First we need to create our converted invoice with using the result of the conversion and setting its decimal precision to 2 digits since it is returned with more decimal digits.
  * Add a Map component inside the loop after the currency conversion and expand the bottom panel.
  * Add a temporary variable to map the current invoice, by doing the following:
    * Right click on any variable on the right hand panel and select Extract and paste in the following JSON that represents what we want our resulting invoice looks like and click on Copy Node button

    ```json
    {
      "invnum": "IN4001",
      "invdate": "2023-01-26",
      "businessname": "ACME Corp",
      "billtoname": "Cesar Bowman",
      "vat": "15%",
      "totalamt": 500.00,
      "currency": "USD",
      "status": "Paid"
    }
    ```
  * Right click on any variable on the right hand panel and select Paste and name the variable `invoiceResponse`
  * Click on it expand this variable
  * Expand `currencyConvertResponse` in the left hand panel
    * Add a map function using the '+fx' button, select DecimalPrecision is the Math category.
      * Drag a line from `currencyConvertResponse->result` to `decimal`
      * Set `precision` to 2
      * Drag a line from `output` to `invoiceResponse->totalamt`
      ![map1](images/lab4-map1.png)
      * Click on the DecimalPrecision function title to minimize and continue the mapping
    * Drag a line from `currencyConvertResponse->query->to` to `invoiceResponse->currency` in the right hand panel
  * Expand `GetInvoicesByStatusOutput->response_resultSet` in the left hand panel and drag lines from:
    * `invoice_invnum` to `invoiceResponse->invnum` in the right hand panel
    * `invoice_invdate` to `invoiceResponse->invdate` in the right hand panel
    * `invoice_businessname` to `invoiceResponse->businessname` in the right hand panel
    * `invoice_billtoname` to `invoiceResponse->billtoname` in the right hand panel
    * `invoice_vat` to `invoiceResponse->vat` in the right hand panel
    * `invoice_status` to `invoiceResponse->status` in the right hand panel
  * Click Save
  ![map1](images/lab4-map1_.png)
* Then we add the converted invoice to the response list and calculate the response grand total.
  * Add another Map component after the previous one and expand the bottom panel.
  * Add an AppendList map function from the List catagory
    * Drag a line from `response->invoices[]` on the left to `docList`
    * Drag a line from `invoiceResponse` to `docIn`
    * Drag a line from `docList` to `response->invoices[]` on the right
    ![map2](images/lab4-map2-AppendList.png)
  * Add an AddFloats function
    * Drag a line from `response->grandTotal` to `num1`
    * Drag a line from `currencyConvertResponse->result` to `num2`
    * Drag a line from `output` to `response->grandTotal`
    ![map2](images/lab4-map2-AddFloats.png)
  * Complete the response fields
    * Drag a line from `HTTPSServerGetOutput->queryParams->currencycode` on the left to `response->currency` on the right
    * Drag a line from `HTTPSServerGetOutput->queryParams->status` on the left to `response->status` on the right
    * Set Value of `response->success` to `true`
    ![map2 addFloats](images/lab4-map2.png)
  * Click Save

Your integration is complete and should look like this:
![integration](images/lab4-integration.png)

* Enable your integration and make an API call from the Browser, Postman or curl as follows:

  ```bash
  curl --location --request GET 'https://<dataplane-hostname>:9443/invoices?status=Overdue&currencycode=EUR'
  ```

Your result should look similar to the following:

  ```json
  {
      "grandTotal": 1072.19,
      "invoices": [
          {
              "invnum": "IN4001",
              "invdate": "2023-07-26",
              "businessname": "ACME Corp",
              "billtoname": "Cesar Bowman",
              "vat": "15%",
              "status": "Overdue",
              "currency": "EUR",
              "totalamt": 466.17
          },
          {
              "invnum": "IN4003",
              "invdate": "2023-09-24",
              "businessname": "Crypto Corp",
              "billtoname": "Jane Doe",
              "vat": "15%",
              "status": "Overdue",
              "currency": "EUR",
              "totalamt": 606.02
          }
      ],
      "currency": "EUR",
      "status": "Overdue",
      "success": true
  }
  ```
