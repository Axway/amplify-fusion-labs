Before you start, make sure you have Salesforce and Hubspot accounts that you can access.

## Lab 1

In this lab, we'll set up a Salesforce push topic and start our integration by adding a Salesforce Pushtopic listener as a trigger to our integration.

* Create a new project in Amplify Integration for this CRM cloud integration. Use a unique name in case your not the only one to do this lab on your Amplify Integration tenant.
* Follow the instructions [**here**](assets/salesforce-connection.md) to setup a Salesforce Connected OAuth App and an Amplify Integration Salesforce Connection and generate a token and test the connection \
![salesforce connection](images/lab1-salesforce-connection.png)
* Create a PushTopic in the Salesforce Developer Console
  * Open the Salesforce Developer Console \
    ![salesforce menu](images/lab1-salesforce-menu.png)
  * Click Debug -> Open Execute Anonymous Window \
    ![salesforce developer console](images/lab1-salesforce-developer-console.png) \
    ![salesforce apex code](images/lab1-salesforce-apex-code.png)
  * In the Enter Apex Code window, paste in the following Apex code, and click Execute:

    ```java
    PushTopic pushTopic = new PushTopic();
    pushTopic.Name = 'ContactPush';
    pushTopic.Query = 'SELECT Id, Name, Phone, Email FROM Contact';
    pushTopic.ApiVersion = 58.0;
    pushTopic.NotifyForOperationCreate = true;
    pushTopic.NotifyForOperationUpdate = false;
    pushTopic.NotifyForOperationUndelete = false;
    pushTopic.NotifyForOperationDelete = false;
    pushTopic.NotifyForFields = 'All';  
    insert pushTopic;
    ```

    ![salesforce apex code pushtopic](images/lab1-salesforce-apex-code-pushtopic.png)

* Go back to your Amplify Integration project
* Create a Plug for Salesforce (e.g. SFDCContactPush), and configure it:
  * Select the Salesforce Connection you created previously
  * Select `SubscribePushTopic` for Actions
  * Select `/topic/ContactPush` you've just created for Objects
  * Select RECEIVE_NEW_EVENTS for Replay Id
  ![salesforce pushtopic plug](images/lab1-salesforce-pushtopic-plug.png)
  * Click Generate and then Save to create your Plug
* Create an integration for CRM cloud integration
  * Click on the Event button and select the Salesforce Pushtopic component
  * Select the Salesforce Connection and Plug you created above

  ![salesforce contact](images/lab1-salesforce-new-contact.png)
  ![salesforce contact](images/lab1-salesforce-contact.png)
* Go to the Monitor and click on the transaction and see that you consumed the pushtopic contact
  ![transaction monitoring details](images/lab1-transaction-monitoring-details.png)

## Lab 2

In this lab, we'll retrieve the contact and desired fields based on the id from the new contact pushtopic. We'll use a Salesforce query component and a query Contact by id Plug.

* Disable your integration to continue designing the integration
* Click the plus icon to add a step after the trigger event 
* Select a Salesforce query component and select your Salesforce Connection
  ![salesforce query component init](images/lab2-salesforce-query-component-init.png)
* Click Add on the Plugs and name your Plug and give it a description (e.g. SFDC_Get_Contact_by_Id) and Configure it
  * Select your Salesforce Connection 
  * Select `Query` for Actions
  * Select `Contact` for Objects
  * Select Id, FirstName, LastName and Email for the fields
  * Click on the Where clause button and select Id for the field and `=` for the operation
  ![salesforce query plug configure](images/lab2-salesforce-query-plug-configure.png)
* Click Generate and then Save to create your Plug
  ![salesforce query plug](images/lab2-salesforce-query-plug.png)
* Return to your integration and select the plug you just created for your query component
  ![salesforce query component](images/lab2-salesforce-query-component.png)
* In the left pane (pipelin in) expand `SFDCContactPushOutput` and expose the `SFDCContactPushOutput/sobject/Id`
* In the middle pane under ACTION PROPERTIES expand `SFDC_Get_Contact_by_IdInput` to expose the `SFDC_Get_Contact_by_IdInput/where/where_Id` and drag a line between the two nodes and click Save
  ![salesforce query component input](images/lab2-salesforce-query-component-input.png)
* Enable the integration, add a new Salesforce Contact and inspect your transaction in the Monitor to see the contact with the fields we specified in the Plug
  ![transaction monitoring](images/lab2-transaction-monitoring.png)

## Lab 3

In this lab, we'll use the retrieved contact and insert it into Hubspot. We'll use a Hubspot create component and an associated create Plug.

* Follow [**this guide**](assets/hubspot-connection.md) to create  Hubspot Connection
* Disable your integration to continue designing the integration
* Click on the plus sign to add a new step to the integration and select a Hubspot Create component 
  ![add hubspot create component](images/lab3-add-hubspot-create-component.png)
* Select the Hubspot connection you just created
  ![hubspot create component init](images/lab3-hubspot-create-component-init.png)
* Click on the Add button next to the Plugs so we can create a Hubspot plug to Create a Contact. 
* Provide a name and description and click on Create
  ![hubspot plug create](images/lab3-hubspot-plug-create.png)
  ![hubspot plug init](images/lab3-hubspot-plug-init.png)
* Click on Configure and do the following:
  * Select your Hubspot Connector

  ![salesforce contact creation](images/lab3-salesforce-contact-creation.png)
  ![hubspot contact created](images/lab3-hubspot-contact-created.png)

## Lab 4 - Challenge yourself!

In this lab, we'll post a message to MS Teams with the contact details.

We'll use the MS Teams Incoming Webhook Connector so that we can Post a message to a MS Teams channel.

* Follow the instructions [**here**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/add-incoming-webhook) to get a URL to a MS Teams channel
  * If you don't use Teams or don't have the webhook capability, you can use a test webhook online app like [Webhook.site](https://webhook.site) instead for this lab.
* Disable to integration and add an HTTP/S Client Post Connection to your integration
  ![add https client post](images/lab4-add-https-client-post.png)
  ![https client post component init](images/lab4-https-client-post-component-init.png)
* Click Add next to Connection so we can create an HTTP/S Client Connection to the MS Teams Incoming Webhook Connector URL and give the connection a name and description and do the following:
  * Select HTTPS for Protocol
  * Select HTTP/2 for HTTP Version
  * Enter the MS Teams Incoming Webhook Connector URL and press Update
  ![https client connection name](images/lab4-https-client-connection-name.png)
  ![https client connection](images/lab4-https-client-connection.png)
* Return the integration and select the MS Teams Connection
  ![https client post component](images/lab4-https-client-post-component.png)
* In the ACTION PROPERTIES section, expand `HTTPSPostInput` to expose the body and right click on body and select SetValue
  ![https client post component setvalue](images/lab4-https-client-post-component-setvalue.png)
* Follow the screen shots below to type the POST body and press the + button to select Name and Email from `SFDCContactPushOutput` and press Save
  ![https client post component setvalue variable1](images/lab4-https-client-post-component-setvalue-variable1.png)
  ![https client post component setvalue variable2](images/lab4-https-client-post-component-setvalue-variable2.png)
  ![https client post component setvalue text](images/lab4-https-client-post-component-setvalue-text.png)
* Enable your integration and create a new Salesforce contact and see the new contact in Hubspot and you should also have a message in your MS Teams channel as follows:
  ![microsoft teams message](images/lab4-microsoft-teams-message.png)

Your final flow should like this:
